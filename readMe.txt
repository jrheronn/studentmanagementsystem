4. Delete a student
5. Insert a new student
6. Transfer a student from one course to another
7. Display the course list
8. Display the student list

Assumptions

- I added the prompt to add the student's email also for option (5). In the instructions for option (5) for adding a new student to a course, it does not have the instruction for adding the student's email. This would have left it empty in the student list.
